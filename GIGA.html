    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>GIGA Ministry was founded in 2020 by Minister Brian Fanaka, born out of a divine revelation. What began as a small group gathering has blossomed into a vibrant and dynamic ministry dedicated to transforming lives and communities through faith, service, and innovation. Inspired by a calling to spread the Gospel and create a supportive spiritual community, Minister Fanaka envisioned a ministry that would go beyond the walls of traditional church settings and reach people in all walks of life.</p>
